# Chima Nwosu | Clearscore Code Test

Time taken: I took a little over 4hrs due to fiddling with Vite config

## Commands

- **Start:** `npm run dev`
- **Test:** `npm run test`

## Highlights

- Accessibility (aria-labels)
- Container/Presentation pattern
- Minimizing refetch of the same data

## Concessions

- I would've loved to mock one of the endpoints and/or test if clicking the close button toggles the class to show/hide the drawer
- Creating some sort of loading screen if the detail api call takes long or errors instead of just showing blank
- Adding a click handler to the drawer background to also close the drawer for added usability 

## Other Notes

- The close svg failed to import after a few tries so i just swapped this out with a close button
- Instructions in the markdown was a little misleading, the designer's comments say design for the drawer is still in progress but there's a picture in the files with a drawer design that looks pretty much done
- I wasn't sent the github repo link on time so to show at least some history of the commits, i uploaded it to my own repo [here](https://github.com/Chima42/cloudscore-code-test)
